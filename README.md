# breast_cancer_predict
The proposed machine-learning approaches could predict breast cancer as the early detection of this disease could help slow down the progress of the disease and reduce the mortality rate through appropriate therapeutic interventions at the right time.![0_jneFxu2eewrfgVKv](https://github.com/Authikesavan/breast_cancer_predict/assets/129832678/de9cf851-8970-4293-9f91-32129f894e8f)

Early prediction can reduce the mortality rate significantly

The analysis is divided into four sections, 
Identifying the problem and Data Sources
Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-Processing the Data
Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign
--
Part_1: Identifying the problem and Getting data.
We'll used Python modules to import external data sets for the purpose of getting to know/familiarize ourself with the data to get a good grasp of the data and think about how to handle the data in different ways.
--
Part_2: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this notebook, we'll get familiar with the data using data exploration and visualization techniques using python libraries (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. Familiarity with the data is important which will provide useful knowledge for data pre-processing)
--
Part_3: Pre-Processing the data
We'll use feature selection to reduce high-dimension data, feature extraction and transformation for dimensionality reduction. This is essential in preparing the data before predictive models are developed.
--
Part_4: Predictive model using Support Vector Machine (svm)
We'll construct a predictive model using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. The diagnosis of a breast tumor is a binary variable (benign or malignant). we'll also evaluate the model using confusion matrix the receiver operating curves (ROC), which are essential in assessing and interpreting the fitted model.
--
Part_5: Optimizing the Support Vector Classifier
We'll aim to tune parameters of the SVM Classification model using scikit-learn.
